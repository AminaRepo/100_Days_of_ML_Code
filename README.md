# 100_Days_of_ML_Code

This Repositery is related to the 100DayslOfMLCode challenge. So every writted code in this purpose will be available in this repository.

The challenge will be devided in three phases:
 ### phase 1: learning 
 It will be dedicated to the process of learning ML. 
 ### phase 2: finding a project
 I have to find a broject to contribute to. If I can't find one, I will create my own project.
 ### phase 3: contributing
 After defining the project I will work on, I will code every day, until my contribution end.
 
All along, two branches will be available:
#### 1- master branch
will contain my personal code.
#### 2- Replicated-code branch
will contain the codes I learned, found, read from my learning process.
