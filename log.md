# 100 Days Of ML Code Log


### Day 0: July 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have set up the 100_Days_of_ML_Code repositery. Added a project related to the youtube channel "Coding Train" 
that I'm learning from . Added some code related to first session. It's about implementing a binary tree search and visualisaiton using
JavaScript. I created a branch containing the exact code of the youtube channel (Replicated-Code). The master branch will contain my
versions of code.
**Thoughts:** I hesitated to Start today, because from now I have to code 1 hour every day! Concerning JavaScript, the concepts where verry
easy to understand ( I didn't need yet to do a documentation search about the language).

### Day 1: July 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I added the visulation part to the binary tree (same code in the youtube video). Nex days I will have to write my own code (as planned in my Github project Binary Tree).

**Thoughts:** I used the p5 library for the first time, it seems interesting. I can't wait to use it for my version of the visualisation part of the tree.

### Day 2: July 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I redefined the conception of the binary tree. Started my version visulation part. At the same time, I started learning Machine Learning (I jumped to session 3 of the youtube playlists I am watching). This time, the files are commited to the master branch. 

**Thoughts:** The examples in [p5 examples] (https://p5js.org/examples/) were very helpful. I have issues about calcluating tree's nodes positions. Right now I don't see any relationship between the tree and ML (may be the language could be helpful).

### Day 3: July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I modified the calculation of the nodes' coordinates, but still working on it. I also enrolled to the [Machine learning free courses of Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

**Thoughts:** I may start coding the KNN algorithm after I am done with the binary tree

### Day 3: July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added a search part. I have to fix and enhance the visualization part. I started the course: [Machine learning free courses of Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) today. I am in week one.

**Thoughts:** The courses I am following are in python. May be I will program the KNN algorithm in python.

### Day 4: July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I fixed the visualization part and the nodes' order issue. I finished week1 of the course: [Machine learning free courses of Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) today. 

**Thoughts:** I was wrong about the language use, it's octave and not python. So I will continue programming with javascript unless I need to use another language.
