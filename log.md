# 100 Days Of ML Code Log


### Day 0: July 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have set up the 100_Days_of_ML_Code repositery. Added a project related to the youtube channel "Coding Train" 
that I'm learning from . Added some code related to first session. It's about implementing a binary tree search and visualisaiton using
JavaScript. I created a branch containing the exact code of the youtube channel (Replicated-Code). The master branch will contain my
versions of code.
**Thoughts:** I hesitated to Start today, because from now I have to code 1 hour every day! Concerning JavaScript, the concepts where verry
easy to understand ( I didn't need yet to do a documentation search about the language).

### Day 1: July 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I added the visulation part to the binary tree (same code in the youtube video). Nex days I will have to write my own code (as planned in my Github project Binary Tree).

**Thoughts:** I used the p5 library for the first time, it seems interesting. I can't wait to use it for my version of the visualisation part of the tree.

### Day 2: July 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I redefined the conception of the binary tree. Started my version visulation part. At the same time, I started learning Machine Learning (I jumped to session 3 of the youtube playlists I am watching). This time, the files are commited to the master branch. 

**Thoughts:** The examples in [p5 examples] (https://p5js.org/examples/) were very helpful. I have issues about calcluating tree's nodes positions. Right now I don't see any relationship between the tree and ML (may be the language could be helpful).

### Day 3: July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I modified the calculation of the nodes' coordinates, but still working on it. I also enrolled to the [Machine learning free courses of Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

**Thoughts:** I may start coding the KNN algorithm after I am done with the binary tree

### Day 3: July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added a search part. I have to fix and enhance the visualization part. I started the course: [Machine learning free courses of Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) today. I am in week one.

**Thoughts:** The courses I am following are in python. May be I will program the KNN algorithm in python.

### Day 4: July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I fixed the visualization part and the nodes' order issue. I finished week1 of the course: [Machine learning free courses of Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) today. 

**Thoughts:** I was wrong about the language use, it's octave and not python. So I will continue programming with javascript unless I need to use another language.

### Day 5: July 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started a new project related to linear regression. Implemented a simple univariate linear regression (not finished yet). This code is related to the exercise given in   [Exercise 2: Linear Regression](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/DocumentPage.php?course=MachineLearning&doc=exercises/ex2/ex2.html) with a little modification (it's why the code is in Replicated-code branch). My version in javascript will follow later. The data of the code can be downloaded from the page cited above.

**Thoughts:** I will implement the KNN algorithm later. Found a data repository related to machin learning from which I downloaded some sets : [UCI machine learning repository](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/DocumentPage.php?course=MachineLearning&doc=exercises/ex2/ex2.html)

### Day 6: July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am in week2 of my course in coursera. It's about multivariate linear regression. I also added two calculus in the previous linear regression code (the plot of the cost function regarding to the number of iteration) and the plot of the cost functions for all the thetas variables calculated.

**Thoughts:** I have to verify the values calculated (the last plot dose'nt seem right).

### Day 7: July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I almost finished week2 of my course in coursera. I verified the caluculs of the code of linear regression, added some plots and cleaned the code.

**Thoughts:** The 3D  plot of the cost function using only the thetas calculated from the gradient descent algorithm has not any sense. So I ploted instead a linear plot that shows the variation of the cost functions regarding the values of the thetas caluculated during the algorith cited above.

### Day 8: July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started implementing the linear univariate regression with javascript. I used the same data used in octave, but converted into txt files. I implemented the loading of data and its ploting. Next day I will enhance the ploting, before implementing the regression using the gradient descent algorithm.

**Thoughts:** I thought that p5 libray had a ploting function; I was wrong. I had to implement it my self.

### Day 9: July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Enhancing of the ploting in progress. 

**Thoughts:** Starting to think about the choice of the project of the 100_Days_of_ML_Code challenge.

### Day 10: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the ploting. Now I have to implement the gradient descent algorithm. 

**Thoughts:** Still searching for an ML project

### Day 12: July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am at the end of the week2 of coursera course (I have to finsish the submission exercises).

**Thoughts:** I started the implementation of the regression estimation algorithm in javascript.

**Link to work:** [my linear regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-unvariate-linear)


### Day 13: July 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the estimation algorithm in javascript. May be I will add a ploting of the cost function (regarding the number of iterations). 

**Thoughts:** Perhaps I will use the plotly.js library to plot the cost function.

### Day 14: July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the univariate linear regression using Javascript. I added the ploting of the cost function using Plotly.js library. The examples in [line charts tutorials from the library website] (https://plot.ly/javascript/line-charts/) where very helpful.

**Thoughts:** I had issues with the plotly library. First, I ploted the cost function every iteration. But I had a 'too much' recursion error. So, I decided to plot the cost function every 50 iterations.

### Day 15: July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the multi univariate linear regression using octave. I used the steps provided in the coursera exercise as a guide. I used gradient descent and normal equation computation. The file is in Recplicate-code branch.

**Thoughts:** I have to implement it in javascript (only the gradient descent algorithm).

### Day 16: July 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started the multivariate regression in javascript. I used octave to convert one file of data to two files (xdata.txt and ydata.txt). The x features values must be in a text file and separated by a space (columns delimiter is a space character).
 
**Thoughts:** The code must works for any number of x features. The plotting of the data will no longer be needed.

### Day 17: July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I added the normalization of the data (function normalizeData). I had to use the library [math.js](http://mathjs.org/). It defines functions that was useful for manipulating arrays and some other calcluations.
 
**Thoughts:** After normalization, I have to define the function that calculates the approximation parameters \theta.

### Day 18: July 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I finished the multivariate regression calculation in javascript. I ploted only the cost function for every iteration (without any issues). The code should work for any number of features.

**Thoughts:** To verify my calculations, I compared it with the values given in octave. I had the same results for the same Alpha's and number of iterations values.

### Day 19: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I decided today to start a project and to continue learning at the same time. I found projects in two websites: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) and [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/).

**Thoughts:** I selected four projects. May be I will have to choose one of them. Meanwhile, I am continuing my coursera courses.

**Link to work:** ( no code yet).


### Day 20: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I choose two projects to begin with. And I am continuing my coursera courses.

**Thoughts:** I have to take other courses about available technologies and libraries (tensorflow.js, ml5, Scikit-Learn ... etc)

**Link to work:** ( no code yet).


### Day 21: July 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I wrote the code about ml5 from the "coding Train" video stream (with a small modification).

**Thoughts:** I have a WebGl warning issue. The classifier works, but I still have a warning on the console.

### Day 22: July 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I started coding with tensorflow. I used examples in [seedbank] (https://tools.google.com/seedbank/). I wrote and run my code using colab notebook. 

**Thoughts:** I will try later other codes related to ML.

**Link to work:** [tensorflow begining] (https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/Replicated-code/begin_tf)



### Day 23: July 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I tested another example from  [seedbank] (https://tools.google.com/seedbank/). It is about linear regression. Later I will do the tasks related to this example.

**Thoughts:** The code is about a modified linear regression. A lot of different libraries where used. It is different from the previous one, in the sense that it doesn't use a graph ( may be it is written this way uniquely for tests purpose).

**Link to work:** [tensorflow linear regression] (https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/Replicated-code/tf_linear_regression)


### Day 24: July 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I added a graph session to execute the code, and proposed values for the training (task1). I added to the file the solution proposed. 

**Thoughts:**  I defined the steps I will follow for the ML projects I selected. In the repo I will report my advances in the project in Projects section and in this log  too.

### Day 25: August 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I proposed values for the training (task2). And I modified the previous version of ml5-begin code. The example about [the file input](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createFileInput) was very helpful.

**Thoughts:**  I had a 100% of identification of one of the images I tested (it's the [blue jay image]  (https://www.audubon.org/news/get-know-these-15-common-birds). It means (I suppose) that the image was in the training set of "MobileNet"  model. I had also an other p5 error (index error). This error doesn't appear at every execution (or at every loading of the html file).

### Day 26: August 02, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I started the first ML project. I am in step 1 : Data exploration. Before any statistics or displays of data, am trying to understantd the meaning of the features (and them relationships with a heart disease).

**Thoughts:** I am thinking of using a neural network for the prediction.

**Link to work:** no code yet.


**Today's Progress**:  I am still in data exploration phase.

**Thoughts:** I am using octave to extract the data (and to retreive the first statistics).

**Link to work:** no code yet.






### Day 28: August 04, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  For the project, I used octave to extract and convert the data into valid matrices. I applied the sigmoid linear function. Then, I tested the results with the test data and made my first submission.

**Thoughts:** The paire wise plotting of the features showed some interesting relashionships between them. 

**Link to work:** For the first submission, I obtained the 0.35689 as a loss value. I will write the sigmoid  classification function in  javascript for more tests.
