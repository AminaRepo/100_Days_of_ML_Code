# 100 Days Of ML Code Log


### Day 0: July 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have set up the 100_Days_of_ML_Code repositery. Added a project related to the youtube channel "Coding Train" 
that I'm learning from . Added some code related to first session. It's about implementing a binary tree search and visualisaiton using
JavaScript. I created a branch containing the exact code of the youtube channel (Replicated-Code). The master branch will contain my
versions of code.
**Thoughts:** I hesitated to Start today, because from now I have to code 1 hour every day! Concerning JavaScript, the concepts where verry
easy to understand ( I didn't need yet to do a documentation search about the language).

### Day 1: July 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I added the visulation part to the binary tree (same code in the youtube video). Nex days I will have to write my own code (as planned in my Github project Binary Tree).

**Thoughts:** I used the p5 library for the first time, it seems interesting. I can't wait to use it for my version of the visualisation part of the tree.

**Link to work:** [Binary Tree](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/Replicated-code/binary-tree)

### Day 2: July 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I redefined the conception of the binary tree. Started my version visulation part. At the same time, I started learning Machine Learning (I jumped to session 3 of the youtube playlists I am watching). This time, the files are commited to the master branch. 

**Thoughts:** The examples in [p5 examples] (https://p5js.org/examples/) were very helpful. I have issues about calcluating tree's nodes positions. Right now I don't see any relationship between the tree and ML (may be the language could be helpful).

**Link to work:** [my Binary Tree](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-binary-tree%20)


### Day 3: July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I modified the calculation of the nodes' coordinates, but still working on it. I also enrolled to the [Machine learning free courses of Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

**Thoughts:** I may start coding the KNN algorithm after I am done with the binary tree

**Link to work:** [my Binary Tree](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-binary-tree%20)


### Day 3: July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added a search part. I have to fix and enhance the visualization part. I started the course: [Machine learning free courses of Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) today. I am in week one.

**Thoughts:** The courses I am following are in python. May be I will program the KNN algorithm in python.

**Link to work:** [my Binary Tree](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-binary-tree%20)


### Day 4: July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I fixed the visualization part and the nodes' order issue. I finished week1 of the course: [Machine learning free courses of Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) today. 

**Thoughts:** I was wrong about the language use, it's octave and not python. So I will continue programming with javascript unless I need to use another language.

### Day 5: July 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started a new project related to linear regression. Implemented a simple univariate linear regression (not finished yet). This code is related to the exercise given in   [Exercise 2: Linear Regression](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/DocumentPage.php?course=MachineLearning&doc=exercises/ex2/ex2.html) with a little modification (it's why the code is in Replicated-code branch). My version in javascript will follow later. The data of the code can be downloaded from the page cited above.

**Thoughts:** I will implement the KNN algorithm later. Found a data repository related to machin learning from which I downloaded some sets : [UCI machine learning repository](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/DocumentPage.php?course=MachineLearning&doc=exercises/ex2/ex2.html)

**Link to work:** [linear regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/Replicated-code/linear-regression)

### Day 6: July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am in week2 of my course in coursera. It's about multivariate linear regression. I also added two calculus in the previous linear regression code (the plot of the cost function regarding to the number of iteration) and the plot of the cost functions for all the thetas variables calculated.

**Thoughts:** I have to verify the values calculated (the last plot dose'nt seem right).

**Link to work:** [linear regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/Replicated-code/linear-regression)



### Day 7: July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I almost finished week2 of my course in coursera. I verified the caluculs of the code of linear regression, added some plots and cleaned the code.

**Thoughts:** The 3D  plot of the cost function using only the thetas calculated from the gradient descent algorithm has not any sense. So I ploted instead a linear plot that shows the variation of the cost functions regarding the values of the thetas caluculated during the algorith cited above.

**Link to work:** [linear regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/Replicated-code/linear-regression)


### Day 8: July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started implementing the linear univariate regression with javascript. I used the same data used in octave, but converted into txt files. I implemented the loading of data and its ploting. Next day I will enhance the ploting, before implementing the regression using the gradient descent algorithm.

**Thoughts:** I thought that p5 libray had a ploting function; I was wrong. I had to implement it my self.

**Link to work:** [my linear regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-unvariate-linear)

### Day 9: July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Enhancing of the ploting in progress. 

**Thoughts:** Starting to think about the choice of the project of the 100_Days_of_ML_Code challenge.

**Link to work:** [my linear regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-unvariate-linear)



### Day 10: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the ploting. Now I have to implement the gradient descent algorithm. 

**Thoughts:** Still searching for an ML project

**Link to work:** [my linear regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-unvariate-linear)


### Day 12: July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am at the end of the week2 of coursera course (I have to finsish the submission exercises).

**Thoughts:** I started the implementation of the regression estimation algorithm in javascript.

**Link to work:** [my linear regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-unvariate-linear)


### Day 13: July 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the estimation algorithm in javascript. May be I will add a ploting of the cost function (regarding the number of iterations). 

**Thoughts:** Perhaps I will use the plotly.js library to plot the cost function.

**Link to work:** [my linear regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-unvariate-linear)




### Day 14: July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the univariate linear regression using Javascript. I added the ploting of the cost function using Plotly.js library. The examples in [line charts tutorials from the library website] (https://plot.ly/javascript/line-charts/) where very helpful.

**Thoughts:** I had issues with the plotly library. First, I ploted the cost function every iteration. But I had a 'too much' recursion error. So, I decided to plot the cost function every 50 iterations.

**Link to work:** [my linear regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-unvariate-linear)


### Day 15: July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the multi univariate linear regression using octave. I used the steps provided in the coursera exercise as a guide. I used gradient descent and normal equation computation. The file is in Recplicate-code branch.

**Thoughts:** I have to implement it in javascript (only the gradient descent algorithm). 

**Link to work:** [multi-variate linear regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/blob/Replicated-code/linear-regression/univariateLR.m)


### Day 16: July 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started the multivariate regression in javascript. I used octave to convert one file of data to two files (xdata.txt and ydata.txt). The x features values must be in a text file and separated by a space (columns delimiter is a space character).
 
**Thoughts:** The code must works for any number of x features. The plotting of the data will no longer be needed.

**Link to work:** [my multi-variate linear regression (javascript)](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-mvariate-linear)


### Day 17: July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I added the normalization of the data (function normalizeData). I had to use the library [math.js](http://mathjs.org/). It defines functions that was useful for manipulating arrays and some other calcluations.
 
**Thoughts:** After normalization, I have to define the function that calculates the approximation parameters \theta.

### Day 18: July 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I finished the multivariate regression calculation in javascript. I ploted only the cost function for every iteration (without any issues). The code should work for any number of features.

**Thoughts:** To verify my calculations, I compared it with the values given in octave. I had the same results for the same Alpha's and number of iterations values.

**Link to work:** [my multi-variate linear regression (javascript)](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-mvariate-linear)


### Day 19: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I decided today to start a project and to continue learning at the same time. I found projects in two websites: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) and [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/).

**Thoughts:** I selected four projects. May be I will have to choose one of them. Meanwhile, I am continuing my coursera courses.

**Link to work:** ( no code yet).


### Day 20: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I choose two projects to begin with. And I am continuing my coursera courses.

**Thoughts:** I have to take other courses about available technologies and libraries (tensorflow.js, ml5, Scikit-Learn ... etc)

**Link to work:** ( no code yet).


### Day 21: July 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I wrote the code about ml5 from the "coding Train" video stream (with a small modification).

**Thoughts:** I have a WebGl warning issue. The classifier works, but I still have a warning on the console.

**Link to work:** [ml5 begining] (https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/Replicated-code/ml5-begin)


### Day 22: July 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I started coding with tensorflow. I used examples in [seedbank] (https://tools.google.com/seedbank/). I wrote and run my code using colab notebook. 

**Thoughts:** I will try later other codes related to ML.

**Link to work:** [tensorflow begining] (https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/Replicated-code/begin_tf)



### Day 23: July 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I tested another example from  [seedbank] (https://tools.google.com/seedbank/). It is about linear regression. Later I will do the tasks related to this example.

**Thoughts:** The code is about a modified linear regression. A lot of different libraries where used. It is different from the previous one, in the sense that it doesn't use a graph ( may be it is written this way uniquely for tests purpose).

**Link to work:** [tensorflow linear regression] (https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/Replicated-code/tf_linear_regression)


### Day 24: July 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I added a graph session to execute the code, and proposed values for the training (task1). I added to the file the solution proposed. 

**Thoughts:**  I defined the steps I will follow for the ML projects I selected. In the repo I will report my advances in the project in Projects section and in this log  too.

**Link to work:** [tensorflow linear regression] (https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/Replicated-code/tf_linear_regression)



### Day 25: August 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I proposed values for the training (task2). And I modified the previous version of ml5-begin code. The example about [the file input](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createFileInput) was very helpful.

**Thoughts:**  I had a 100% of identification of one of the images I tested (it's the [blue jay image]  (https://www.audubon.org/news/get-know-these-15-common-birds). It means (I suppose) that the image was in the training set of "MobileNet"  model. I had also an other p5 error (index error). This error doesn't appear at every execution (or at every loading of the html file).

**Link to work:** [tensorflow linear regression] (https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/Replicated-code/tf_linear_regression), [my ml5 begin](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-ml5-begin).


### Day 26: August 02, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I started the first ML project. I am in step 1 : Data exploration. Before any statistics or displays of data, am trying to understantd the meaning of the features (and them relationships with a heart disease).

**Thoughts:** I am thinking of using a neural network for the prediction.

**Link to work:** no code yet.


**Today's Progress**:  I am still in data exploration phase.

**Thoughts:** I am using octave to extract the data (and to retreive the first statistics).

**Link to work:** no code yet.





### Day 28: August 04, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  For the project, I used octave to extract and convert the data into valid matrices. I applied the sigmoid classification function. Then, I tested the results with the test data and made my first submission.

**Thoughts:** The paire wise plotting of the features showed some interesting relashionships between them. 

**Link to work:** For the first submission, I obtained the 0.35689 as a loss value. I will write the sigmoid  classification function in  javascript for more tests.


### Day 29: August 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am continuing my coursera courses. At the same time I am writing the javascript code for the logistic regression.

**Thoughts:** I want to make the code works for any text file selected by the user.

**Link to work:** no code yet.



### Day 30: August 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote the functions related to the data file handling (and data extraction) for the javascript logistic regression.

**Thoughts:** I have now to implement the logistic regression method.

**Link to work:** [my_logistic_regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-logistic-regression).



### Day 31: August 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I fisnished the code related to the logistic regression. I added a screenshot of the execution ([screenshot](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/blob/master/my-logistic-regression/screenshot.png).

**Thoughts:** I have to verify the calculations.May be, I will add to it some functionalites ( prediction and theta values saving ). 

**Link to work:** [my_logistic_regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-logistic-regression).


### Day 32: August 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I saving nd predictions functions to the code. I added a screenshot of the new updated interface ([screenshot](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/blob/master/my-logistic-regression/screenshot2.png).

**Thoughts:** After more than 100.000 iterations, I submitted the test results, with a cost value equal to 0.40698. The value is  greater than the first one (I used for the first submission octave fminunc function parametrized with only 400 Iterations). But it doesn't matter, since the objective of this code is to test the data's behavior (see how the thetas values change over iterations).
**Link to work:** [my_logistic_regression](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/my-logistic-regression).



### Day 33: August 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am following the tutorial [Build your First Deep Learning Neural Network Model using Keras in Python] (https://medium.com/@pushkarmandot/build-your-first-deep-learning-neural-network-model-using-keras-in-python-a90b5864116d), 
and  [Kaggle Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRd3UzdBeo) video for my project.

**Thoughts:** I don't know if using jupyter (in local host) can be as easy as colab (I have to install some libraries before I start).

**Link to work:** no code yet.


### Day 34: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the code. I submited the results, I scored  0.36069. I used the same parameters in the tutorial.
The confusion matrix values was: [[12  3][ 6 15]]. I didn't change any parameter (only the number of feature). But I skiped the transformation of the categorical feature ( it was already changed). 
 
 
**Thoughts:** The accuracy value (and my test results) changed at every execution. The worst one was 75% corresponding to the submitted prediction that scored 0.3069 . An other value equal to 83% scored the worst loss value (0.50236). I have to check the parameters used.

**Link to work:** [my firs NN](https://github.com/AminaRepo/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/myFirstNN)


### Day 35: August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did some reasearch about parameter selection (for neural networks). I selected some interesting papers.
 
**Thoughts:** There is a lot of learning techniques. A lot of variations for each technique. A lot of Ideas to enahance those techniques. A lot of tools, librairies ....etc. But, since I am intereseted in neural networks, and since I know which aspect of the neural network I am concerned with (I mean, the aspect I think it have to be changed or enhanced), helped me through this research.

**Link to work:** no code yet.


### Day 36: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Dedicated day for learning python.
 
**Thoughts:** Interesting language (I see why it is whidely used in ML ). I makes some necessary operations for ML (list manipulations, string processing ... etc) simple. The libraries installation it's simple and easy too.

**Link to work:** no code yet.


### Day 37: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Dedicated second day for learning python.
 
**Thoughts:** Spent time in my coursera courses too.

**Link to work:** no code yet.



### Day 38: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Third day for learning python.
 
**Thoughts:** Amazing language. A lot of Beautiful things.

**Link to work:** no code yet.


### Day 39: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** The penultimate day of my python's language learning.

**Thoughts:** I have to plan what I will do for at least one week in advance.

**Link to work:** no code yet.



### Day 40: August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I finished my python learning. It dosen't mean that I know  everything about the language. It just means that I can now write efficiently (I hope) with this language.

**Thoughts:** the next focus will be on libraries.

**Link to work:** no code yet.


### Day 41: August 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I tried to install python libraries listed by google search (the 29 libraries listed on the top of the search page for python libraries). I was able to install only eight from 11 libraries using pip. 

**Thoughts:** For some librararies I have to find another way to install them (like tensorflow). 

**Link to work:** no code yet.


### Day 42: August 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Today I installed 8 other libraries (from 20). I think the problem is the platform I am using. I will try later; for the libraries I couldn't install, to install them on ubuntu.

**Thoughts:** This time, the goole search gave another list of libraries ( I have written down the names of libraries listed yesterday). So, the toal of all the libraires listed by google is 50. I don't have to install all of them. It is just for a test purpose. Later, I will have to select the most important ones (that I will need).

**Link to work:** no code yet.

### Day 43: August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I added 2 other libraries that  wasn't listed.oday I installed 13 other libraries (from 21). Some of them were unavailable, and some others failed to install.

**Thoughts:** I thought that the libraries where differents for the two versions of python ( 2 and 3)
 But when installing, I found that the links and the versions of the downloaded packages were the same. So, after installing a library for python2, the corresponding downloaded package (the cached archive) was used for the installation with python3.

**Link to work:** no code yet.



### Day 44: August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Trying to install tensorflow (must build from source). It requires Bazle to be installed. So, I have to build Bazle first. The distribution archive took time to download (still downloading right now). In the meanwhile, I am trying to install Theano. It needed scipy which failed to install first because of missing Fortran. After installing it, it generated other errors.

**Thoughts:** I will spend more more days to install these libraires . If it doesn't work, I will try with ubuntu.

**Link to work:** no code yet.


### Day 45: August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I installed q reqdy binary package py-scipy and py3-scipy. Then I installed theano. But when I tested the import of theano, it generated errors (the errors where different between python2 and python3). The compilation of Bazel failed too. The error concerned java memory issue.

**Thoughts:** May be I will try ubuntu before investigating in those problems.

**Link to work:** no code yet.


### Day 46.  August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** For the installation of tensorflow on Ubuntu I followed the instructions in [installing tensorflow on Ubuntu](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux). After upgrading pip, I have got un error after following the command of the installation . I changed it for :python2 -mpip install tensorflow. I ommited the use of "sudo" because it desa tivated the cache. But after  installing, and importing tensorflow, I've  got " illegal instruction (core dumped) error. Regarding the [github issue] (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/17411) it has to do with the version of tensorflow (I have to downgrade it). I will check it out later. The installation page is part of the tutorial pages of tensorflow. I tried this one [basic classification] (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification)in colab.

**Thoughts:** May be In the tutorial page cited above, there is a link to [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).What is great with the page of the link, is that it contains a considerable list of classifier.

**Link to work:** [basic classifier] (https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/core/tutorials/keras/basic_classification.ipynb)



### Day 47.  August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** From [github tesnsor flow issues] (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/19104) and from [Github tensorflow v 1.6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases?after=v1.6.0) the problem is that starting from version 1.6, "Prebuilt binaries will use AVX instructions.", so " This may break TF on older CPUs". So I unistalled tensorflow, and installed version 1.5. I also added two other papers to read, and I started to read one of them.

**Thoughts:**  I had problems downloading the version 1.5 of tensorflow (time out errors)

**Link to work:** [Reading paper 1] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305851017_An_overview_on_weight_initialization_methods_for_feedforward_neural_networks)


### Day 48.  August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:**  I installed theano without any issues and I finished the first paper reading. 

**Thoughts:** I didn't found what I am looking for from the cited methods. May be I will in the second paper. Nevertheless, I will search if there is corresponding or resembling methods in tensorflow (or an other library).

**Link to work:** no code yet.



### Day 49.  August 25, 2018

****Today's Progress:** I finished a half week of coursera courses  (I was late in the courses schedule)

**Thoughts:** I learned some interesting facts that I can use in my porject 1.

**Link to work:** no code yet


### Day 50.  August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I started the submission exercices for the last week.

**Thoughts:** I will try later to use similar code for my project 1.

**Link to work:** no code yet.


### Day 51.  August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I finished the submission exercices.

**Thoughts:** using fmincg function for learning doesn't show how the learning process is done.

### Day 53.  August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I started the following week of coursera courses. For the problem of building tensorflow, since I will use on linux tensorflow version 1.5, and to avoid  possible issues related to the newer versions
		     and to avoid possible issues related to the newer versions, I decided to build the same version (1.5) . So, I downloaded the corresponding version of blaze which is 0.8.0. I installed 
		    the corresponding gcc version 2 (the version installed is 4.2.1, the needed one must be at least 4.8, the one I installed is 4.9.4). I 

**Thoughts:**   I have later to correct path issues concerning the gcc verison (the one referred to by the system is still the older version). 

**Link to work:** no code yet. In [installing tensorflow from source](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources) you can find all the corresponding working versions of tensorflow, gcc, blaze ...etc  


### Day 54. August 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress:**  I finished the week of courses and the quiz. I have to do the assignment. 

**Thoughts:**  I decided to focus on my Coursera courses first (the deadline approaches).
