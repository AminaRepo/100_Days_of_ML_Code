# 100 Days Of ML Code Log


### Day 0: July 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have set up the 100_Days_of_ML_Code repositery. Added a project related to the youtube channel "Coding Train" 
that I'm learning from . Added some code related to first session. It's about implementing a binary tree search and visualisaiton using
JavaScript. I created a branch containing the exact code of the youtube channel (Replicated-Code). The master branch will contain my
versions of code.
**Thoughts:** I hesitated to Start today, because from now I have to code 1 hour every day! Concerning JavaScript, the concepts where verry
easy to understand ( I didn't need yet to do a documentation search about the language).

### Day 1: July 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I added the visulation part to the binary tree (same code in the youtube video). Nex days I will have to write my own code (as planned in my Github project Binary Tree).

**Thoughts:** I used the p5 library for the first time, it seems interesting. I can't wait to use it for my version of the visualisation part of the tree.
